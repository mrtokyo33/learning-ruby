# Boolean logic
# to determine wheter an expression evaluates to true or false, you'll need a comparison operator

# == (equals) returns true if the values compared are equal
5 == 5 #=> true
5 == 6 #=> false

# != (not equal) return true if the values compared are not equal
5 != 7 #=> true
5 != 5 #=> false

# > (greater than) returns true if the value on the left of the operator is larger than the value on the right
7 > 5 #=> true
5 > 7 #=> false

# < (less than) returns true if the value on the left of the operator is smaller than the value on the right
5 < 7 #=> true
7 < 5 #=> false

# >= or <= (greater than or equal than)/(less than or equal than) is the same, but if the value is equal returns true also
5 >= 5 #=> true
7 >= 6 #=> true
5 <= 3 #=> false


# eql? checks both the value type and the actual value it holds
5.eql?(5.0) #=> false; although tey are the same value, one is  integer and the other is a float
5.eql?(5)   #=> true

# equal? checks whether both values are the exact same object in memory. This can be slightly confusing because of the way computers store some values for efficiency. 
# Two variables pointing to the same number will usually return true.
a = 5
b = 5
a.equal?(b) #=> true
# This expression is true because of the way computers store integers in memory. Although two different variables are holding the number 5, they point to the same object in memory. However
a = "hello"
b = "hello"
a.equal?(b) #=> true 
# This happens because computers canâ€™t store strings in the same efficient way they store numbers. The computer has created two separate string objects in memory.


# <=> (spaceship operator) unlike the other operators, which all return true or false, the spaceship op. returns -1, 0, 1
# -1 if the value on the left is less than the value on the right
# 0 if the value on the left is equal to the value on the right
# 1 if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right
5 <=> 10 #=> -1
10 <=> 10 #=> 0
10 <=> 5  #=> 1


# Logical operators
# && and
# || or


# Case statements
# Case statements are a neat way of writing several conditional expressions that would normally result in a messy if...elsif statement
