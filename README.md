# learning-ruby
Welcome to my "Learning Ruby" repository! This is where I document my journey of learning Ruby, from the fundamentals all the way to advanced topics. While I may not need Ruby for my day-to-day work, I find it useful to understand different programming paradigms and languages. In this repo, I‚Äôll be sharing my exploration of Ruby, including challenges I encounter, solutions I find, and small projects I build along the way.
üßë‚Äçüíª What‚Äôs Inside?

This repository will include:

    Basic Concepts: Starting with the very basics, I will cover Ruby syntax, object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, and core libraries.
    Intermediate Projects: As I progress, I will work on intermediate-level projects, exploring more complex Ruby features and patterns.
    Advanced Topics: Eventually, I‚Äôll dive into advanced Ruby topics, including metaprogramming, design patterns, and performance optimizations.
    Security and Hacking Projects: My end goal is to focus on vulnerabilities and hacking-related projects. Ruby's flexibility makes it a great language for testing out security concepts, exploiting weaknesses, and building small security tools.
    Small Projects: From time to time, I‚Äôll create small, fun projects that demonstrate the practical use of Ruby in various domains.

üöÄ My Goal

Ultimately, I intend to:

    Master Ruby: From the basics to advanced topics, I want to become proficient in Ruby.
    Build Useful Projects: As I learn, I will build projects that I can share with the community, solve real-world problems, or experiment with security vulnerabilities.
    Explore Hacking and Security: One of the main objectives of this journey is to create tools, scripts, and systems focused on understanding and exploiting vulnerabilities, as well as learning ethical hacking.

If you're also learning Ruby or have experience with it, feel free to contribute, suggest improvements, or even fork the repository to share your own learning process. Collaboration and open knowledge are key to growing together!
üìå Roadmap

    Start with Ruby basics (variables, data types, conditionals, loops)
    Dive into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (classes, inheritance, modules)
    Learn Ruby libraries and tools (standard library, gems)
    Explore Web Development with Ruby (Rails, Sinatra)
    Understand and experiment with security concepts (vulnerabilities, ethical hacking)
    Build small security-focused projects (e.g., simple exploits, security tools)
