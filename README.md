# learning-ruby

Welcome to my "Learning Ruby" repository! This is where I document my journey of learning Ruby, from the basics to advanced topics. Along the way, I will share challenges, solutions, small projects, and explore how Ruby can be used for solving real-world problems, including **physics** and **math** projects.

## üßë‚Äçüíª What‚Äôs Inside?

- **Basic Concepts**: Ruby syntax, object-oriented programming (OOP), and core libraries.
- **Intermediate Projects**: More complex Ruby features and patterns.
- **Advanced Topics**: Metaprogramming, design patterns, and performance optimizations.
- **Security and Hacking Projects**: Focusing on vulnerabilities, exploiting weaknesses, and building security tools.
- **Small Projects**: Fun, practical Ruby projects in various domains.
- **Physics & Math Projects**: Using Ruby to solve physics and mathematical problems, from simulations to numerical methods.

## üöÄ My Goal

- **Master Ruby**: Become proficient in Ruby, from basics to advanced topics.
- **Build Useful Projects**: Create and share projects that solve real-world problems or explore security.
- **Explore Hacking and Security**: Learn ethical hacking and create security-related tools and scripts.
- **Apply Ruby to Physics & Math**: Use Ruby to model physical systems, solve math problems, and experiment with computational methods.
